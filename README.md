### Goals
- Goal for thsi project is to provide a solution for the stated problem statement.
- Build an online recipe book for traditional Italian Recipes.
- Allow users to post and share recipes.
- Any visitor should be able to view recipes.
- Registered users should be able to share recipes with photo and description.
- Registered users should be able to like and comment on recipes.
- Application should be responsive on different screen sizes.
- Application should provide a simple intuitive interface that is easy to navigate.
- Sites layout and colorscheme is pleasing and keeps users coming back to it.

### User Interface(UI) Design
A wireframe for the home page was made using powerpoint.

### Model Design
Each table was designed 

## Development Process
### Development Stragey
Agile methodologies were applied in the development process of this project. Following principles were followed durint he process:
- Development process maintained flexible, so chnages could be implemented if it yielded better results.
- Features where kept to minimum, avoiding useless features.
- Features were implemented in order of priority.
- Project was developed in small iterations in order ensure functionality of each feature implemented.
- Github Project board was used as an information radiator to manage feature implementation.
- User Stories were used to designing user centric features

### User Stories
User Stories were made using the Github _Issues_ feature. Each issue equated a User Story. Each Issue was tagged with a lable, a Github Issues feature, based on it's importance for the application. Following labels were created (listed in order of importance): 
- Must have
- Should have
- Could-Have
- Won't-Have

Issues were added on the Github Projects Boards, a builtin management tool from GitHub, as tasks. The implementation of the features was tracked by moving the tasks on each of the boards column. Three columns were named: Todo, InProgress and Done.
